Webscrapping bot to budget itens

This is my first coding project in python, the following code was created by some necessities that appeared into my daily routine as a civil engineer trainee. As simples as it is, the bot will get some itens from a excel file and give you back a new excel file creating sheets for every item described, with all itens that will appear into the first google shopping's page, where there will be 60 or less lines of search results in columns divided by: ITEM DESCRIPTION| VALUE| SHIPPING PRICE| LINK URL FOR ITEM.
